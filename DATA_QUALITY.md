# Data Quality in dbt-synthea

## Overview

In dbt-synthea we aim to demonstrate best practices around proactive monitoring of data quality in the OMOP ETL.  We plan to implement a comprehensive suite of data and unit tests which will help to detect and prevent ETL bugs as well as to characterize the quality of the input Synthea dataset.

## OMOP CDM Quality

The quality of the OMOP CDM output by dbt-synthea is monitored using `dbt test`, as specified in the OMOP model schema files in [models/omop/_models](./models/omop/_models).

To ensure our quality bar and definition of data quality are consistent with the standards enforced by the OHDSI community, we have implemented the [DataQualityDashboard](https://github.com/OHDSI/DataQualityDashboard) quality checks as dbt tests here in the dbt-synthea project.

The OMOP CDM v5.4 specifications and DQD thresholds are parsed directly from their respective GitHub repositories and transformed into yaml using [generate_dbt_yaml.py](./scripts/python/generate_dbt_yaml.py).

Implementation of the DQD checks is still in progress; so far the following checks are included in `dbt test`:

| DQD Check Name                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | dbt test implementation                                    |

### generate_dbt_yaml.py

The `generate_dbt_yaml` Python script may be used to generate the OMOP model schema files for *any* OMOP ETL implemented using dbt.  It is agnostic to data source and database system.  Given the right combination of input files, it supports OMOP CDM v5.4 (the default) as well as v5.3.

The script can be found at [scripts/python/generate_dbt_yaml.py](./scripts/python/generate_dbt_yaml.py).  Its dependencies include:

* Python >=3.12
  * ruamel-yaml
  * requests
* [dbt_expectations](https://hub.getdbt.com/metaplane/dbt_expectations/latest/)
* The macros stored in [macros/generate_dbt_yaml](./macros/generate_dbt_yaml)
* The generic data tests stored in [tests/generic](./tests/generic)
