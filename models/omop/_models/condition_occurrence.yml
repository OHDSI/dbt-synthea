      This table contains records of Events of a Person suggesting the presence of a disease or
      medical condition stated as a diagnosis, a sign, or a symptom, which is either observed by a
      Provider or reported by the patient.

      ## User Guide

      Conditions are defined by Concepts from the Condition domain, which form a complex hierarchy.
      As a result, the same Person with the same disease may have multiple Condition records, which
      belong to the same hierarchical family. Most Condition records are mapped from diagnostic
      codes, but recorded signs, symptoms and summary descriptions also contribute to this table.
      Rule out diagnoses should not be recorded in this table, but in reality their negating nature
      is not always captured in the source data, and other precautions must be taken when when
      identifying Persons who should suffer from the recorded Condition. Record all conditions as
      they exist in the source data. Any decisions about diagnosis/phenotype definitions would be
      done through cohort specifications. These cohorts can be housed in the
      [COHORT](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm531.html#payer_plan_period) table.
      Conditions span a time interval from start to end, but are typically recorded as single
      snapshot records with no end date. The reason is twofold: (i) At the time of the recording the
      duration is not known and later not recorded, and (ii) the Persons typically cease interacting
      with the healthcare system when they feel better, which leads to incomplete capture of
      resolved Conditions. The
      [CONDITION\_ERA](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm531.html#condition_era) table
      addresses this issue. Family history and past diagnoses (‘history of’) are not recorded in
      this table. Instead, they are listed in the
      [OBSERVATION](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm531.html#observation) table. Codes
      written in the process of establishing the diagnosis, such as ‘question of’ of and ‘rule out’,
      should not represented here. Instead, they should be recorded in the
      [OBSERVATION](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm531.html#observation) table, if they
      are used for analyses. However, this information is not always available.

        description:
          The CONDITION_CONCEPT_ID field is recommended for primary use in analyses, and must be
          used for network studies. This is the standard concept mapped from the source value which
          represents a condition

        description:
          This field can be used to determine the provenance of the Condition record, as in whether
          the condition was from an EHR system, insurance claim, registry, or other sources.

      - name: condition_status_concept_id
        description:
          This concept represents the point during the visit the diagnosis was given (admitting
          diagnosis, final diagnosis), whether the diagnosis was determined due to laboratory
          findings, if the diagnosis was exclusionary, or if it was a preliminary diagnosis, among
          others.

              to_condition: domain_id = 'Condition Status'
      - name: stop_reason
        description:
          The Stop Reason indicates why a Condition is no longer valid with respect to the purpose
          within the source data. Note that a Stop Reason does not necessarily imply that the
          condition is no longer occurring.
        data_type: varchar
      - name: provider_id
        description:
          The provider associated with condition record, e.g. the provider who made the diagnosis or
          the provider who recorded the symptom.

      - name: visit_detail_id
        description:
          The VISIT_DETAIL record during which the condition occurred. For example, if the person
          was in the ICU at the time of the diagnosis the VISIT_OCCURRENCE record would reflect the
          overall hospital stay and the VISIT_DETAIL record would reflect the ICU stay during the
          hospital visit.

      - name: condition_source_value
        description:
          This field houses the verbatim value from the source data representing the condition that
          occurred. For example, this could be an ICD10 or Read code.
        data_type: varchar
      - name: condition_source_concept_id
        description:
          This is the concept representing the condition source value and may not necessarily be
          standard. This field is discouraged from use in analysis because it is not required to
          contain Standard Concepts that are used across the OHDSI community, and should only be
          used when Standard Concepts do not adequately represent the source detail for the
          Condition necessary for a given analytic use case. Consider using CONDITION_CONCEPT_ID
          instead to enable standardized analytics that can be consistent across the network.
