    description: The CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table is designed to simplify observational analysis by providing
      the complete hierarchical relationships between Concepts. Only direct parent-child relationships
      between Concepts are stored in the CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP table. To determine higher-level ancestry
      connections, all individual direct relationships would have to be navigated at analysis time. The
      CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table includes records for all parent-child relationships, as well as grandparent-grandchild
      relationships and those of any other level of lineage for Standard or Classification concepts. Using
      the CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table allows for querying for all descendants of a hierarchical concept, and
      the other way around. For example, drug ingredients and drug products, beneath them in the hierarchy,
      are all descendants of a drug class ancestor. This table is entirely derived from the CONCEPT, CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP,
      and RELATIONSHIP tables.
    columns:
      - name: ancestor_concept_id
        description: The Concept Id for the higher-level concept that forms the ancestor inthe relationship.

      - name: min_levels_of_separation
        description: The minimum separation in number of levels of hierarchy between ancestorand descendant
          concepts. This is an attribute that is used to simplifyhierarchic analysis.

          concepts. This is an attribute that is used to simplifyhierarchic analysis.
