  - name: concept
    description: The Standardized Vocabularies contains records, or Concepts, that uniquely identify each
      fundamental unit of meaning used to express clinical information in all domain tables of the CDM.
      Concepts are derived from vocabularies, which represent clinical information across a domain (e.g. conditions,
      drugs, procedures) through the use of codes and associated descriptions. Some Concepts are designated
      Standard Concepts, meaning these Concepts can be used as normative expressions of a clinical entity
      within the OMOP Common Data Model and standardized analytics. Each Standard Concept belongs to one
      Domain, which defines the location where the Concept would be expected to occur within the data
      tables of the CDM. Concepts can represent broad categories (‘Cardiovascular disease’), detailed
      clinical elements (‘Myocardial infarction of the anterolateral wall’), or modifying characteristics
      and attributes that define Concepts at various levels of detail (severity of a disease, associated
      morphology, etc.). Records in the Standardized Vocabularies tables are derived from national or
      international vocabularies such as SNOMED-CT, RxNorm, and LOINC, or custom OMOP Concepts defined
      to cover various aspects of observational data analysis.
