      of examination, questioning or a procedure. Any data that cannot be represented by any other domains,

        description: It is possible that some records destined for the Observation table havetwo clinical
          ideas represented in one source code. This is common withICD10 codes that describe a family
          history of some Condition, forexample. In OMOP the Vocabulary breaks these two clinical ideas
          into twocodes; one becomes the OBSERVATION_CONCEPT_ID and the other becomes theVALUE_AS_CONCEPT_ID.
          It is important when using the Observation table tokeep this possibility in mind and to examine
          the VALUE_AS_CONCEPT_IDfield for relevant information.

        description: This is the concept representing the OBSERVATION_SOURCE_VALUE and maynot necessarily
          be standard. This field is discouraged from use inanalysis because it is not required to contain
          Standard Concepts thatare used across the OHDSI community, and should only be used whenStandard
          Concepts do not adequately represent the source detail for theObservation necessary for a given
          analytic use case. Consider usingOBSERVATION_CONCEPT_ID instead to enable standardized analytics
          that canbe consistent across the network.
