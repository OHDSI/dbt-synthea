    description: This table captures records about the exposure to a Drug ingested orotherwise introduced
      into the body. A Drug is a biochemical substanceformulated in such a way that when administered
      to a Person it willexert a certain biochemical effect on the metabolism. Drugs includeprescription
      and over-the-counter medicines, vaccines, andlarge-molecule biologic therapies. Radiological devices
      ingested orapplied locally do not count as Drugs.
