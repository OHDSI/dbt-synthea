    description: The DOMAIN table includes a list of OMOP-defined Domains to which the Concepts of the
      Standardized Vocabularies can belong. A Domain represents a clinical definition whereby we assign
      matching Concepts for the standardized fields in the CDM tables. For example, the Condition Domain
      contains Concepts that describe a patient condition, and these Concepts can only be used in the
      condition_concept_id field of the CONDITION_OCCURRENCE and CONDITION_ERA tables. This reference
      table is populated with a single record for each Domain, including a Domain ID and a descriptive
      name for every Domain.
    columns:
      - name: domain_id
